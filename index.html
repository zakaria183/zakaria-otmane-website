        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Zakaria Otmane, a fourth-year applied mathematics student at INSA Rennes in France. After completing two years of preparatory classes (MPSI-MP) at Lycée Dupuy de Lôme, I joined INSA Rennes, where I have been actively involved in mathematical research projects. My main areas of interest include partial differential equations, probability theory, and optimization, which are key to solving modern scientific and engineering challenges.</p>
        
        <p>I am driven by a deep desire to understand the theoretical foundations of these fields. At INSA, I study their applications in practical contexts such as dynamic systems modeling and data science. My ambition is to further expand this knowledge to contribute to the advancement of mathematical sciences.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
		    <li>
                <h3>Project 1: Mathematical modeling of crowd evacuation</h3>
                <p>This project was carried out in the second year of the MP class as part of the TIPE (Supervised Personal Initiative Project in English). The objective was to assess the relevance of a macroscopic model in predicting and analyzing an emergency evacuation of a small park, considering safety constraints. To be more precise, I was tasked with studying the movement of a crowd as if it were the flow of a fluid, applying the macroscopic laws of fluid mechanics. This study involved, among other things, the theory of Eulerian descriptions, particle derivatives, and the method of characteristics to solve partial differential equations, such as the mass conservation equation.</p>

                <h3>Project 2: Complex Analysis and Study of the Riemann Zeta Function</h3>
                <p>This project, undertaken as part of my fourth year of studies at INSA, involved writing a thesis in which I conducted an in-depth study of the Riemann zeta function. This function is a central object in complex analysis and number theory. My goal was to explore its analytic and arithmetic properties, including its analytic continuation, functional equation, and its profound connections with prime numbers. The thesis also includes a numerical study of the representations of this function using Python.</p>

                <h3>Project 3: Holomorphic ODEs Around the Notion of Monodromy and Regular Singularities</h3>
                <p>I am currently working on this project with IRMAR. The project focuses on the study of holomorphic ordinary differential equations, specifically exploring the concept of monodromy and the behavior of solutions near regular singularities.</p>
